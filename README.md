  * The seventh edition of this widely-adopted text for special educators addresses the full-range of curriculum and instructional topics involved in educating individuals with moderate, severe, and multiple disabilities. Evidence-based practices are presented in clearly-defined ways so that teachers can easily understand the research presented and apply it in the real classroom. All chapters in the book are unique, written by leaders in the field known for their research and writing on the specific topics. Case studies of students are applied to chapter content in vignettes, tables, and figures found throughout the chapters, and the textbook rests on a solid evidence-base with research citations provided. The new edition features many new updates including: a greater emphasis on teaching students with autism; six new chapters authored by experts in the field; more information on teaching methods supported by research, peer support, teaching academic skills, the process for planning and implementing instruction within general education classrooms, transition planning, and alternate assessment. All core chapters have been strengthened and expanded, and PowerPoint slides are now available for course instructors.
